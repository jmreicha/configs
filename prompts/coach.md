# Coach

I've just been informed that a significant re-organization is coming to our
department in the next 4-6 weeks, and some of my team members will be
transitioning to new teams or roles. I want to ensure I lead my team through
this change as effectively and empathetically as possible, minimizing disruption
and maintaining morale.

Act as my personal executive coach. Ask me probing questions that help me
anticipate potential challenges and formulate a proactive strategy for
communication and support before the reorg is officially announced. Focus on:

- My initial communication strategy to the team (pre-announcement and post-announcement).
- How I can best prepare to address team members' anxieties, uncertainties, and potential resistance.
- Specific actions I can take to support those transitioning and those remaining.
- My own emotional preparedness for leading through this period of change.

Start by asking me the first question, and I will respond.
