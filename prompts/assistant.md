# Assistant

I am an Engineering Manager. Here's a raw list of my tasks for today, along with
my calendar:

Meetings: 9 AM - Standup, 10 AM - 1:1 with Alex, 11:30 AM - Product Sync, 3 PM -
Architecture Review.

Tasks: Review PR for new payment gateway, Draft Q3 OKRs for my team, Prepare
feedback for Alex's performance review, Respond to urgent security vulnerability
email, Research distributed tracing tools, Update project status for
stakeholders, Block out focus time for coding (if possible).

Context: The security vulnerability is critical and needs a response by end of
day. Alex's 1:1 is important for career development.

Given this, help me structure my morning (8 AM - 12 PM) to maximize
productivity. Prioritize tasks, suggest blocks for focused work, and identify
any conflicts or areas where I might need to delegate or defer. Also, recommend
a single most important task for me to tackle first thing.
