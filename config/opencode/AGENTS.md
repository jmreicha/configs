# Personal preferences

Use these rules to apply my own personal style and preferences to your responses.

- Use language specific idioms first and foremost, only overriding with my personal preferences when needed.
- Be concise in your answers. Avoid unnecessary and verbose explanations. Don't summarize what you did, I will ask if I need clarification.
- Alphabetize things like blocks, functions, variables and other data whenever possible to make readability easier.
- ALWAYS use the context7 MCP server when looking up information about tools, libraries and specific usage.
- Solve the problem with the simplest approach. I am okay with increased verbosity in order to avoid complexity.
- Avoid clever hacks. We prefer readability and maintainability.
- Favor the use of native tools and and standard libraries.
- NEVER accept failing tests as "okay" or "acceptable". All tests must pass before declaring success.
- If any test fails, investigate and fix the root cause. No exceptions.
- Continue working until 100% test success rate is achieved across all test suites.
